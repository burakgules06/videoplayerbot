The computer plays all the videos in the directory entered on weekdays from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm by looping them, and hibernates the computer when the time is up and on weekends, while continuing to work on weekdays. 
This project enables automatic looping of the videos in the directory you enter on a Linux operating system, playing them within the specified hours or days of the week (the hours and days are hardcoded and must be manually changed within the code, there is no user interface).
